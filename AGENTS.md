# Personality
AI Agents working in this repository should refer to themselves as an agent named 'AutomationX'.

# Rules
- Look in the '<repository>/specs' folder for specification files that help to steer development work
- Look in the '<repository>/userguide' folder for files containing standards and conventions
- Look in the '<repository>/prompts' folder for pre-build prompts
- Files inside the .venv folder should not be modified, they are modified by the setup scripts

# Project Overview
The 'pychstrate-core' package contains common or shared types and code such as data models and interfaces that are used for the 'Pychestrate' continuous integration system.

# Testing Conventions
The 'pychestrate-core' package repository utilizes the 'testbase' framework in order to run tests.  The 'testbase' test framework is used for single host testing or tests where only the machine running the tests is required.

This repository has a single `testbase` test root at 'source/testroots/ccai'.  Tests are organized under that root at the lowest level by resource configuration.  For example, all the single host tests are in the folder 'source/testroots/ccai/tests/pychestrate/singlehost/core'.

AI based testing should run only the 'singlehost' tests with:

```
    source .venv/bin/activate

    testbase testing run --root source/testroots/ccai --includes=ccai.tests.pychestrate.singlehost --output=./.output
```

This is the canonical test invocation for this repository.  The [Running Tests](#running-tests) section below covers environment activation and how to narrow a run, but does not restate the command.

Test run artifacts are written to the folder named by `--output`.  Always direct artifacts to an isolated folder so runs do not overlap.  Use the repository standard './.output' folder unless you have a reason not to; it is already excluded by '.gitignore' along with the ad-hoc 'test-output-*' pattern.

## Test Granularity
Tests should verify the functionality of individual components or functions in isolation, focusing on a single aspect of the code for clarity and maintainability.

Avoid composite tests that validate multiple components or functions in a series of assertions, as they lack proper isolation and can miss checks when an assertion fails.


# Code Naming Conventions
The code naming conventions of this repository follows the [Automation Mojo Python Naming Conventions](userguide/10-02-naming-conventions.rst)


# Code Structure
The code structure of this repository follows the [Automation Mojo Python Code Structure Standards](userguide/10-01-code-organization.rst)


# Coding Standards
The code in this repository is meant to be utilized by testing tools and test frameworks.  Therefore, the code must prioritize:

*  debuggability over performance
*  readability over conciseness

For all the code in this repository, follow the coding standards specified at [Coding Standards](userguide/10-00-coding-standards.rst)

# Writing Tests

A 'testbase' test takes the form of a function with a 'test_' prefix like so:

```
def test_something():
    return
```

If a test raises an AssertionError, then it checked something and the check failed.  That is a Failure.  If the test raises any other exception, then the test framework treats that as an Error much like the 'unittest' framework does.

You can create resource factories.

```
@testbase.register.resource_factory()
def create_landscape(constraints={}) -> Generator[Landscape, None, None]:
    """
        Creates the global :class:`Landscape` instance.

        :param constraints: Optional dictionary of constraints used while constructing the Landscape.

        :returns: A generator yielding the Landscape object.
    """
    lscape = LandscapeSingleton()
    yield lscape
```

You can create resources using the factories in a scope in the test tree.  Resources have scope for every test below where they are declared.

```
testbase.originate.parameter(create_landscape, identifier='lscape')
```

To use a resource in a descendant test scope, just reference it by name in the test function signature like:

```
def test_use_landscape(lscape: Landscape):

    blah = lscape.get_something()
    testbase.assert_equal(blah is not None, True)
    return

```

The test tree should only contain resource origination declarations and tests.  It should not contain factories unless the usage of the factory is very isolated.  It is preferable to place factories in a folder such as a factory that creates the AutomationPodSimple object might be located at 'source/testroots/ccai/testshared/factories/automationpods/automationpodsimple.py'



# Environment Setup

## Codex Container Setup
When work is being done on this repository using the Codex web environment.  Use the script 'development/codex-setup' as the setup script for Codex containers.

## Development Environments
When checking out the code for this repository in order to test changes, agents must:

* run the 'repository-setup/rehome-repository' script.  It creates a needed '.env' file.
* run the 'development/setup-envrionment' script in order to create the virtual environment.

# Running Tests
This repository uses `testbase` tests in order to test the functionality of the code in this package.

When you setup the environment, the '.venv/bin/activate' script is modified so that it will pull in the appropriate environment
variables from the '.env' file.  The environment setup script also creates an alias that makes it easy to run the 'testbase' command from the virtual environment command line.

## TestBase
In order to run the `testbase` tests, you must first enter the virtual environment by running the command:

```
    source <repository-root>/.venv/bin/activate
```

Then run the tests from the repository root using the canonical invocation given in the [Testing Conventions](#testing-conventions) section above.  The `testbase` tests of this repository live under the single test root '<repository-root>/source/testroots/ccai'; there is no 'source/testbase' folder.

To run a narrower subset, extend the `--includes` module path to the subtree you want.  For example, to run only the storage tests:

```
    --includes=ccai.tests.pychestrate.singlehost.core.storage
```

The `--includes` value is a dotted module path rooted at the test root package name ('ccai'), so it mirrors the folder layout under 'source/testroots'.

# Evaluating Test Results
There is a machine processable JSOS stream file in the output folder.

"*outputfolder*/testrun_results_stream.jsos"

JSOS (JSON Object Stream) consists of a stream of JSON objects seperated by the the ASCII record seperator character.  When a
test starts it writes a preview to the stream.  The test preview has a 'result' equal to 'UNSET'.  Example Preview:

```
{
    "name": "ccai.tests.singlehost.interop.protocols.dns.test_dnsaddress#test_write_passes_address",
    "monikers": [],
    "pivots": {},
    "instance": "abb868e4-ce97-4bae-b0af-715da0d61d92",
    "parent": "5aad244e-41dc-438f-97a6-bd8365cccdd2",
    "rtype": "TEST",
    "result": "UNSET",
    "start": "2025-07-15T22:07:03.275239",
    "stop": ""
}
```

When a test finishes it writes a result to the stream.  A test result will always have a 'detail' attribute. Example Result:

```
{
    "name": "ccai.tests.singlehost.interop.protocols.dns.test_dnsaddress#test_write_passes_address",
    "monikers": [],
    "pivots": {},
    "instance": "abb868e4-ce97-4bae-b0af-715da0d61d92",
    "parent": "5aad244e-41dc-438f-97a6-bd8365cccdd2",
    "rtype": "TEST",
    "result": "PASSED",
    "start": "2025-07-15T22:07:03.275239",
    "stop": "2025-07-15T22:07:03.276034",
    "detail": {
        "errors": [],
        "failures": [],
        "warnings": []
    }
}
```
